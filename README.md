I am an Teaching Fellow at the School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London. I am currently finishing my Ph.D. by the Business School at Birkbeck College, University of London. My research interests span empirical asset pricing, investor sentiment, and machine learning.

My research has been presented at conferences organized by the Royal Economic Society (RES), the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), and the World Finance Conference. 

I hope you find the material posted here useful.
